                <p>Tell me, are you tired of reading books by talented writers who have nothing to say? And are you tired of books by people with a lot to say but no talent for literature? Well if you are, then you have come to the right place. Because on this website, you will find books and stories written by a person who combines the best of both worlds. You will find the collected works of a no-talent hack with nothing to say. <br> <br>
                He is the perfect “serious” writer for people with no taste in literature, one whose artistically-challenged prose is applied to one “big work” after another in which he attempts to convey his “big ideas.” Though as you will see upon reading the man’s works, the deep thoughts he presents come off like little more than the ruminations of a grade-school dropout with too much time on his hands. The sorts of ideas that can be taken seriously only by people with IQs in the mid-double-digits. And when those vapid ideas are presented in barely-literate English, the result is an authentic marvel of mediocrity.<br> <br>
                So if your taste is bad enough—and your intelligence low enough—this guy could be the perfect writer for you.</p>

                    Do I have to answer? Do I have to say something? Because I know that I should only offer constructive criticism, so it’s hard to think what to say… Though one thing I can tell you is that I don’t think he deserved to be thrown out of writing class the way he was. His writing wasn’t that bad, was it?” <br> <br>
                  <u>The author’s former creative writing instructor</u>: “No comment.” <br><br>
                  <u>Some guy the author met in a bar</u>: “Hey, what was that guy talkin’ about just now? Sayin’ that stuff-a yours sucks so bad. What’s that all about? Cause like sure it sucks and all that, but it don’t suck near as bad as what he says it does.” <br>

Like didn’t I read a couple pages of that book of yours? And didn’t I tell ya that it was great? I did. I sure as hell did. But now ya say that ya want me to read more of it?

                Sure, why not? Why not give it a try? Because after all, he has nothing to lose but what little self-respect he may still retain.
